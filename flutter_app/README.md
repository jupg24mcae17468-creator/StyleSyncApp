# StyleSync Flutter Demo

A simple offline demo of the StyleSync salon app built with Flutter, Provider and sqflite (local sqlite). This scaffold includes:

- Welcome, SignIn, SignUp
- Home with bottom navigation
- Stylists, Services, Appointments, Profile
- Local in-memory demo data via provider

How to run:

1. Install Flutter SDK.
2. Open this folder in your IDE.
3. Run `flutter pub get`.
4. Run `flutter run` on an emulator or device.

Note: This is a demo scaffold. Replace the simple SharedPreferences-based auth with a real backend (Firebase Auth) and switch data persistence to sqflite/Firestore as needed.
